# **Planning**

The planning phase was structured using the 5 UX planes - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface.

## **Strategy Plane**

The initial idea for this project was to create an ordering application for my friend’s food business in order to facilitate customers to order online as the venue has a limited number of seats. It turns out that an online booking system could also assist to manage customer expectations.  

### **Target Audience**

- Business owner
- Users: current users, new users that are not registered, food enthusiasts 

### **Site Goals**

- Create an easy-to-use booking and ordering system.
- Make the application responsive, so it can be used on desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes.


## **Scope Plane**

To get a better understanding of what the application will look like I have listed the features and sorted them into necessary and nice-to-have features.

### **Necessary Features:**

- User can log in to the application.
- User can register to the application.
- Orders/Booking can be added, updated and deleted.
- Menu.
- About - opening hours, address for collection and contact details.

### **Nice-to-have Features:**

- customer reviews.


## **Structure Plane**

**EPIC: User Authentication:**

This epic focuses on the foundational aspects of user management and authentication, ensuring users can securely access the platform. It includes functionalities such as logging in, logging out, password reset and user registration.

| User Story                                                                                                                              | Priority       |

## **Surface Plane**

### **Design**
### **Colors and Fonts**
I wanted to keep it simple and light. The color palette matches the cover image and is well suited color scheme for the full website.

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was the website I've used to fetch the colour palette presented.

![Colour Palette](readme_img/coolors.png)

The Fonts used are [Roboto Serifs](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Serif?query=robot+ser) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montse).

### **Logo**
[LOGO](https://logo.com/) was the webstie I've used to created logo for this project.

### Future Implementations

A few user stories were excluded from the current project due to time limitations. They are visible in on the dedicated [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Darioc18/projects/2) kanban board for this project. The following are some of features that could be implemented in future iterations and that have been added to the *future implementations* on the kanban board:

# **Deployment**

Here is the [link to the deployed project](https://pp4-cheesecake-c25e3fb56709.herokuapp.com/).

## **Create Repository**

The first step is to create a new repository, using the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). After creating the repository, you can open it in the IDE of your choice.

## **Project Setup**

1. Install **Django** and **gunicorn**:
   - `pip install django gunicorn`
2. Install supporting **libraries**:
   - `pip install dj_database_url psycopg2`
3. Create **requirements.txt** file:
   - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
4. Create a Django project:
   - `django-admin startproject <name>` (in my case `<name>` was *cheesecake_shop*)
5. Test to see if everything worked:
   - `python manage.py runserver`
   
## **Database Setup**

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/) for the PostgreSQL Database.

1. Log in to your account
2. Click *Create New Instance*
3. Give the instance a name and select the plan of your choice, *Tiny Turtle* is the free plan.
4. Click *Select Region* and choose a data center near you
5. Click *Review* and if the details are correct click *Create instance*
6. Click on the created instance and copy the database URL

## **Heroku Setup**

1. Log in to your [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/) account
2. On the dashboard click *New* - *Create new app*
3. Give the app a unique name
4. Select the region closest to you and click *Create app*
5. Select your created app and open the *Settings* tab 
6. At the *Config Vars* section click *Reveal Config Vars* and add the following:
   - **DATABASE_URL** with the copied URL from ElephantSQL
   - **SECRET_KEY** with your secret key
   - **PORT** with the value 8000
   - **CLOUDINARY_URL** with the copied URL from Cloudinary
   - **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** with the value 1

## **Final Changes**

1. Add `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["PROJECT_NAME.herokuapp.com", "localhost"]` in **settings.py**
2. Create a **media**, **static** and **templates** directory and a **Procfile** file in the base directory
3. Add `web gunicorn pipetracker.wsgi` to **Procfile**
4. In your **Heroku app**: 
   - Go to the *Deploy tab* and connect your GitHub repository
   - Click on *Deploy Branch* at the bottom of the page

## **Forking**

Forking creates a copy of the project on GitHub. Follow these steps to fork this repository:
1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to [the Cheesecake repository](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/PipeTracker).
2. Click the **Fork** button on the top right of the repository.
3. You can now open the forked copy of this project as your own repository.
4. Follow the above steps to work on the project.

## **Packages**

- [django-extensions](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - collection of custom extensions for the Django Framework, used for generating the ERD.
- [gunicorn](https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/) - Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.
