# **Planning**

The planning phase was structured using the 5 UX planes - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface.

## **Strategy Plane**

The initial idea for this project was to create an ordering application for my friendâ€™s food business in order to facilitate customers to order online as the venue has a limited number of seats. It turns out that an online booking system could also assist to manage customer expectations.  

### **Target Audience**

- Business owner
- Users: current users, new users that are not registered, food enthusiasts

### **User Goals**

- ### **Site Goals**

- Create, edit and cancel a online booking.
- To view menu and booking history.

### **Site Goals**

- Create an easy-to-use table booking system.
- To provide a solution to allow users to view edit and cancel bookings online
- Make the application responsive, so it can be used on desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes.


## **Scope Plane**

To get a better understanding of what the application will look like I have listed the features and sorted them into necessary and nice-to-have features.

### **Necessary Features:**

- User can log in to the application.
- User can register to the application.
- Orders/Booking can be added, updated and deleted.
- Menu.
- About - opening hours, address for collection and contact details.

### **Nice-to-have Features:**

- customer reviews.


## **Structure Plane**

**EPIC 1 - Key site functions:**

This epic efer to the essential features and capabilities that enable the core operations of a website. These functions are crucial for the website to achieve its primary objectives and provide value to users. Examples of key site functions might include user registration and login, content management, or any other critical feature that supports the main purpose of the site."

| User Story                                                                                                                              | Priority       |

## **Skeleton Plane**

### **Wireframes**
The wireframes include a view for desktop and mobile to take responsiveness into account. For those whose layout is different on smaller devices, I created a sample wireframe. The main difference in smaller screen is a collapsed NavBar accessible at the hamburger icon and the footer where the items stack up. 

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for making wireframes.

### **Database Schema**
"The data model for the restaurant project follows Object-Oriented Programming principles and leverages Django's Class-Based Views. User authentication is managed through Django AllAuth. Table bookings are handled by a custom reservation model that records key details such as full name, nickname, booking date and time, number of guests, and any special requests. This reservation model is linked to the User model, ensuring that each booking is associated with a specific user."

## **Surface Plane**

### **Design**

### **Colors and Fonts**
I wanted to keep it simple and light. The color palette matches the cover image and is well suited color scheme for the full website.

[Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was the website I've used to fetch the colour palette presented.

# **Agile**

Agile methodology is a dynamic, iterative approach to project management and software development, focusing on adaptability, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It emphasizes making incremental progress, gathering continuous feedback, and responding to changing requirements throughout the development process.

To check the project's board click [here](https://github.com/users/EdsonSMartins/projects/4). The details of my agile approach can be found in the separate [AGILE.md file](AGILE.md).
